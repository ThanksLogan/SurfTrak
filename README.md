#SurfTrak -- About
##What is my main objective with creating it?

My primary objective of creating my live surf report display is to showcase a live report of the surf for a given location which my database will update to. 


##What problem does it solve?
Surfers love to know the conditions before they drive all the way to the beach, but cannot always rely on the word of mouth, or the conditions from the last time they surfed, since the ocean is always changing. The solution my surf report display brings is that it will display the live conditions of the surf spot with moderate accuracy so that the surfer can decide for himself whether it’s worth it to go or not. 



##Why did I choose to make this project?

My motivation this project lies with my number one hobby when I am not busy with school: surfing. I love the sport and culture of surfing so much that it influenced my decision making in creating a project for this class: CS530. 
A background for this project and some inspiration comes from an existing app: Surfline. This app shows live data coming from all over the world regarding surf conditions, forecasts, and articles about surfing. My idea about creating a live marquee that could display the surf report in real time seemed like a great idea because I wouldn’t have to log into Surfline.
